## Building LLM Agents with Crew AI and More

**In order to set up the LLM Agents (crew), we should consider the following concepts**

### Tasks

These are the tasks that our agents will perform. Each task will be assigned to an agent.


### Agent
1. Perform tasks
2. Make decisions
3. Communicate with other agents

#### Three Components of a Good Agent
1. Good LLM (GPT-x, Mistral, Claude, Gemini)
2. Good Tools (Search, Calculate, Comparision, Shell, ...)
3. Good Agent Frameworks (LangGraph, LlamaIndex, LangChain, CrewAI)

##### Good LLM
1. Handle Long Contexts
2. Handle Long Outputs
3. Good at Reasoning

##### Good Tools
1. Efficient
2. Easy to Use
3. Easy to Extend
4. Easy to Integrate

##### Good Agent Frameworks
1. Good prompts that match the LLM (Same prompt not work for all LLMs)
2. Highly customizations of LLM Tools
3. Easy to use
4. Flexibility

### Tools

These are the tools that our agents will use to perform their tasks. These can be, for example, a search engine, a summarizer, a translator, etc.

### Process

A process dictates the way that our agents will work together. In this case, we will use a sequential process, which means that each agent will work one after the other.
